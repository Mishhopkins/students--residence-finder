# Students' Residence Finder

## Helping You(Campus Student) Find a nearest, affordable, accessible and convenient House or residence

### Introduction
Students' Residence Finder is a web based system I designed to help users (campus students) find the best choice of houses or accomodation quickly and efficiently. By leveraging advanced search algorithms and an extensive database of properties, Students' Residence Finder simplifies the process of house hunting, saving users (campus students) time and effort.

### Installation and Usage Instructions (For End-Users)
To use the Students' Residence Finder, the students will simply visit the website and start searching for properties or houses in their desired location. They can filter results based on various criteria such as the property type i.e. bedsitters, single room, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom e.t.c , price (minimum and maximum budget), and amenities. The Students' Residence Finder also provides detailed information about each property, including photos and contact details for the seller or agent and then allows the student to BOOK the property thereafter.
